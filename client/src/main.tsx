/**
 * ===================================================================
 * MAIN ENTRY POINT - Forum AI Brainstorming Application (Client)
 * ===================================================================
 * 
 * This is the main entry point for the Forum AI brainstorming application.
 * It handles the initial React application setup and rendering into the DOM.
 * 
 * The main file establishes the React application lifecycle and provides
 * the foundation for the entire client-side application.
 * 
 * Key Features:
 * - React 18 concurrent features with createRoot
 * - Strict mode for enhanced development experience
 * - Proper DOM element targeting and type safety
 * - Clean separation of concerns
 * 
 * React Setup:
 * - Uses React 18's createRoot API for improved performance
 * - Enables StrictMode for better error detection
 * - Targets the 'root' element in the HTML document
 * - Provides TypeScript type safety for DOM elements
 * 
 * Application Bootstrap:
 * - Renders the main App component
 * - Establishes the React component tree
 * - Enables concurrent rendering features
 * - Provides development-time warnings and checks
 * 
 * Dependencies:
 * - React 18 for modern React features
 * - ReactDOM for DOM rendering
 * - App component as the root component
 * 
 * @author Forum Development Team
 * @version 1.0.0

/**
 * Initializes and renders the Forum React application.
 * 
 * This code creates a React root using the modern createRoot API
 * and renders the main App component within React StrictMode.
 * 
 * Setup Process:
 * 1. Locates the 'root' element in the HTML document
 * 2. Creates a React root using createRoot API
 * 3. Renders the App component wrapped in StrictMode
 * 4. Enables concurrent rendering features
 * 
 * React StrictMode Benefits:
 * - Detects unsafe lifecycle methods
 * - Warns about deprecated API usage
 * - Helps identify side effects
 * - Enables additional development checks
 * 
 * The root element is expected to exist in the HTML document
 * and serves as the mounting point for the entire application.
