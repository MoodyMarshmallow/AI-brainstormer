# Product Context - Forum

## üéØ **Vision Statement**

Forum is an AI-powered brainstorming platform that transforms single topics into rich, multi-perspective conversation trees. By presenting three distinct AI personalities (Optimist, Pessimist, Realist), users can explore ideas from different angles and follow interesting threads through dynamic, interactive conversations.

- **Explore Optimism**: Discover opportunities, potential, and positive outcomes
- **Challenge Ideas**: Identify risks, problems, and realistic constraints  
- **Find Balance**: Get practical, actionable insights that bridge vision and reality
